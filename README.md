# Bangla-News-Classifion
The project focuses on automating the process of identifying and organizing news content in Bangla, using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

Features:
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, tokenization, and stemming/lemmatization for Bangla text.
Dataset: Includes a curated dataset of Bangla news articles with labeled categories (e.g., politics, sports, entertainment, business, etc.).
Modeling: Uses algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and deep learning models like LSTM, GRU for classification.
Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.
Deployment: Easy deployment using Flask or Django for real-time classification.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow / PyTorch
scikit-learn
NLTK for Bangla language processing
fastText / Word2Vec for word embeddings
